A hardened chromium for desktop Linux inspired by [Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium), using [Fedora's Chromium](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/chromium) as a base. Intended for use with [hardened_malloc](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc) as packaged and provided by [secureblue](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue).

## Scope

### In scope

* Desktop-relevant patches from Vanadium (located in vanadium_patches)
* Changes that increase hardening against known and unknown vulnerabilities 
* Changes that make secondary browser features opt-in instead of opt-out (for example, making the password manager and search suggestions opt-in)
* Changes that disable opt-in metrics and data collection, so long as they have no security implications

### Out of scope

* Any changes that sacrifice security for "privacy" (for example, enabling MV2) <sup>[why?](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/improve-security)</sup>
* Any novel functionality that is unrelated to security

## Installation

Official support is only provided via [secureblue](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/). Unsupported installation is also possible [via COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/secureblue/hardened-chromium/).

## Post-install

Some additions preferences are added to `chrome://settings/security`, these provide addition security and privacy controls should they be needed. There is also a Website Dark Mode preference added to `chrome://settings/appearance`.
\
\
Additionally, the following flags are available that provide extra hardening but may cause breakage or usability issues:

- `chrome://flags/#network-service-sandbox`
- `chrome://flags/#show-punycode-domains`
- `chrome://flags/#disable-cross-origin-referrers`

Other flags are also provided for compatibility should you experience an issue related to some of the hardening enabled by default.
